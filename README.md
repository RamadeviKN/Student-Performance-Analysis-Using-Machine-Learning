## How to Use This Repository
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RamadeviKN/Machine-Learning-Projects.git

- **Libraries Used**: 
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For visualizations

## Steps Followed

### 1. Importing the Libraries
Imported the necessary libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.

### 2. Importing the Dataset
The dataset is loaded using pandas.

### 3. Encoding Categorical Data
Categorical variables were encoded using label encoding or one-hot encoding where necessary.

### 4. Splitting the Dataset
We split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

### 5. Training the Multiple Linear Regression Model
We applied multiple linear regression on the training set.

### 6. Predicting the Test Set Results
The trained model was used to predict the test set results.

### Evaluation
The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as R-squared.

### Visualizations
We used various plots to visualize the data and model performance:

**Histogram**: Showed the distribution of the dataset.
**Residual Plot**: Illustrated the residual errors.
**Heatmap**: Highlighted correlations between variables.
**Pair Plot**: Displayed relationships between features.

### Conclusion
This project builds a solid foundation in regression techniques, using linear regression to predict student performance based on several factors. The visualizations helped in interpreting the relationships and understanding the model's behavior.
